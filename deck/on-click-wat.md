# Let's talk about events in React

---

```jsx
const handler = () => alert('üôå')
const MyComponent = () => (<button onClick={handler}>üî•</button>)
```

---

```jsx

const handler = () => alert('üôå')
const MyComponent = () => (<button onClick={handler}>üî•</button>)
```
                                  ^ What does this do?

---

## What I assumed

## (until very recently)

---

```jsx
const ref = findDomNode(this)
ref.addEventListener('click', handler)
```

---

```jsx
const ref = findDomNode(this)
ref.addEventListener('click', handler)
```

(or something)

---

## Synthetic Events

---

```jsx
/*
 * Summary of `ReactBrowserEventEmitter` event handling:
 *
 *  - Top-level delegation is used to trap most native browser events. This
 *    may only occur in the main thread and is the responsibility of
 *    ReactDOMEventListener, which is injected and can therefore support
 *    pluggable event sources. This is the only work that occurs in the main
 *    thread.
 *
 *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This
 *    may be done in the worker thread.
 *
 *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to
 *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want
 *    to extract any synthetic events.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with
 *    "dispatches", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.
 */
```

### There is also this neat graph

## tl;dr: it's not that simple

---

## Why does this matter?

---

## üéâ Third party libraries üéâ

---

If you are using a third party library that attaches **native** events (i.e. events **not** handled by React's global event handler) and you need to `stopPropagation()` or `preventDefault()`, you are going to have a bad time.

# E.G.

![](peloton-player.png)

This is a thing I work on

---

![](peloton-player.png)

It uses JWPlayer (which does not use React)

---

![](peloton-player.png)

We customized the controls

---

![](peloton-player.png)

We use React

---

![](peloton-player.png)

We wanted the controls to be keyboard accessible

---

![](peloton-player.png)

JWPlayer uses spacebar and enter to

pause/play the video

---

![](peloton-player.png)

We do not want to pause/play the video while you are trying to adjust the volume
